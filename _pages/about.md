## About Me

I am a Data Science student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, also pursuing a B.A. in Sociology. With a consistent placement on the Dean's List, I am dedicated to academic excellence and applying data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems.

## Education

I'm currently studying at **UNC Chapel Hill** (since August 2023), where my coursework includes Foundations of Data Science, Data Structures, Algorithms & Analysis, Probability, Optimization, Modeling, and Sociology Theories.

## Professional Experience

As a **Business Compliance Consultant Intern** at **Ernst & Young** (May-August 2024), I contributed to risk consulting engagements for financial institutions, focusing on regulatory compliance and internal controls. I conducted assessments across multiple departments, identifying key risk points and operational inefficiencies. Using Python and Excel, I evaluated control effectiveness and developed actionable recommendations to improve enterprise risk frameworks.


## Projects

### ASA DataFest 2025: Office Expansion Analysis

My team won the **Best Visualization Award** out of 58 teams at ASA DataFest 2025 (Duke University). We analyzed U.S. commercial real estate transactions to identify high-growth regions for office expansion in various sectors. I developed treemaps and stacked bar charts using Python (matplotlib, plotly) and engineered a Random Forest classifier that achieved 92.5% prediction accuracy for optimal office locations.

### Marketing Campaign Optimization

I developed a machine learning model to predict customer responsiveness to marketing campaigns for iFood, using customer demographics and platform usage data. Through feature engineering and exploratory data analysis, I implemented Decision Tree models achieving 88% accuracy while ensuring compliance with Brazil's LGPD data regulations.

## Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, scipy, Selenium, PyTorch), SQL, R, Java, C++
- **Tools & Software**: Tableau, Power BI, LaTeX, Microsoft Power Automate, Excel
- **Data Science**: A/B testing, predictive modeling, causal inference, regression analysis, random forests
- **Workflow & Collaboration**: Git, Jupyter, VSCode, agile development
- **Optimization & Measurement**: Experience with designing and analyzing experiments, modeling, and performance evaluation

I'm passionate about leveraging data science to drive decision-making and solve complex problems. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/shengkai-tao-09ba831b1) or check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/kevintao0417).
